see hellow swapi example mondat nov 1 java script json fetch etc


see jackson 

DTO = data transfer object
see week 4 Heelo full stack user login object



hibernate project steps:

work from his example code
Extra Hibernate demo for mapping

-first need hibernate configujration file
-new hibernate database
-or dbeaver to delete tables

-could do: a log back xml file to turn off debug notifications 

Next hibernate util (copy as is)
next each model (each based on the diagram)

	class
	give it entity annotation
	list of data member
		(regular java OOP stuff here, exactlyh accorind to diagram)
	standard boilerplates,  getters setter, etc
	add @ID annotation
	@GeratedValue(stategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
	on private int id;
	
	on author:
	@ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.EEAGER, cascade= CascadeType.ALL) 	
		
		on genre
		same@ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.EEAGER, cascade= CascadeType.ALL) 
		
		publication langauge=same
		@ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.EEAGER, cascade= CascadeType.ALL) 	
		
		note he did fetch type EAGER on all and Cascade type ALL on all
		until soemone asked questions and he is tring MERGE, but not fusrt choise
		
	then next class AZUTHO
@Enitity tag
public class Author
	@Id
	@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)	
	pri int id
	prio String name
	po s name
	p int year born
	@ManyToOne(fetch= FetchType.EAGER)
	p l;angujage native language
	
	//um mhe always wants to be able to get all book by author
	@OneToMany
	priavte List<Book> bibliography;
	
*not @Id is the primary key

now DAOs / repos

1st interfaces (no annotations / same as last projecty)

Next implemetent them:  (code start auto generated)
		public find all (exaMple)
		(see:) Session session= HibernateUtil.getSession();
				List<Author> list = session.createQuery("FROM AUTHOR").list();
				HibernateUtil.closeSession();
				return list;
		next see find by id (in auth dao imp)		
				Autohor author = sessions.get(Author.class,id);
			
		next see updateAuthor
			session.merge(author);	

	q	next see find by name author for slightly more complex SQL query
	
* can only use session.get  get for priomary key
otherwise need HQL


Book Impl mostly the same

	
*** next DAOTEST

create DaoTest class******
first need to createtables and some Genres and languages in the database
	so too dbeaver....(not sure maybe dont need dbeaver setup first)
	nevermind...and back to AuthorDao and it IMPL
	to add insert ****************************************
	Author and BOok add insert******************************
	uses session.save(author/book)
	
	now add inserts to the DAO Test class
	
	The hard parts so far, in here
	 
	*****now add the enties to the hibernate config file
	<mapping class="com.revature.models.Language"></mapping>
	Cc
	cc
	cc
	
	
	in dbeaver he had problems so he added the 
	genre and languages "the bad way" ie manually in dbeaver (but it
	looks like they should have been added in the code)
	so he commented out inserts of DaoTets
	and added a new way
	
	so yeah, I can add things in sdbeaver if need to but not best
	
	
	
	
	
	also session.setParam and things like thgat for ueses
	
	
	--------
	see notes in discord for ec2 setup inc openjdk, maven, git, jenkins and more?
